          Einstein, a German physicist, is best known for his theory of
          relativity and specifically mass–energy equivalence, expressed by the
          equation E = mc2. Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics
          “for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his
          discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.
